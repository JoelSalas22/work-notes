# Lambda Function Anatomy

- `Handler()` Function: Function to be executed upon invocation and it requires two 
arguments an **event** and **context**.

- **Event Object**: Data sent during lambda function invocation.

- **Context Objext**: This is generated by the platform and contains info about
the underlying infrastructure & execution environment such as allowed runtime and 
memory


```python
def lambda_handler(event, context):
    # TODO: Implement
    return {
    'statusCode': 200,
    'body': json.dumps('Hello From Lambda')
    }
```
